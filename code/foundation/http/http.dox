@section Nebula3HttpSystem The Nebula3 Http Subsystem

The Http subsystem offers a complete set of HTTP client- and server-classes. The HttpServer class 
implements simple but complete builtin HTTP server which can communicate with web browsers.
The HttpServer is mainly used to expose runtime debugging data, but it can also be used for
general HTTP communication with the Nebula3 application. A HtmlPageWriter class exists to simplify
writing HTML-formatted pages to an IO::Stream. HttpRequestReader is a IO::StreamReader which
can decode an HTTP request from a web browser. The HttpResponseWriter is a IO::StreamWriter which
encodes a HTTP response with attached content (usually a HTML page or an image) into an IO::Stream.

HttpRequestHandler's process HTTP requests and create a content stream which is sent back
to client web browsers. The HttpServer is extended with new functionality by deriving
new subclasses from HttpRequestHandler and adding instances to the HttpServer.

To connect to a running Nebula3 application on the same machine, open a web browser and
navigate to the following address:

http://127.0.0.1:2100

This should open the applications main page with links to specialized pages implemented by
custom HttpRequestHandlers.
