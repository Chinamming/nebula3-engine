/**
    @class Game::Manager
    
    Managers are Singleton objects which care about some "specific global 
    stuff". They should be subclassed by Mangalore applications to implement
    globals aspects of the application (mainly global game play related stuff).
    
    Managers are created and triggered by game features. The frame trigger
    functions are invoked when the gameserver triggers the game feature.
    
    Standard-Mangalore uses several Managers to offer timing information
    (TimeManager), create entities and properties (FactoryManager), 
    manage game entities (EntityManager) and so forth.

    Managers are derived from Messaging::Port, so you *can* optionally use them to 
    receive and process messages.
