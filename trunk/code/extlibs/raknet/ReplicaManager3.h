/// \brief System to help automate game object construction, destruction, and serialization
/// ReplicaManager3 tracks your game objects and automates the networking for replicating them across the network
/// As objects are created, destroyed, or serialized differently, those changes are pushed out to other systems
/// To use:
/// 1. Derive from Connection_RM3 and implement Connection_RM3::AllocReplica(). This is a factory function where given an identifier for a class (such as name) return an instance of that class. Should be able to return any networked object in your game.
/// 2. Derive from ReplicaManager3 and implement AllocConnection() and DeallocConnection() to return the class you created in step 1.
/// 3. Derive your networked game objects from Replica3. All pure virtuals have to be implemented, however defaults are provided for Replica3::QueryConstruction(), Replica3::QueryRemoteConstruction(), and Replica3::QuerySerialization() depending on your network architecture.
/// 4. When a new game object is created on the local system, pass it to ReplicaManager3::Reference().
/// 5. When a game object is destroyed on the local system, and you want other systems to know about it, call Replica3::BroadcastDestruction()
///
/// At this point, all new connections will automatically download, get construction messages, get destruction messages, and update serialization automatically.
