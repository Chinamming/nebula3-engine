/**
@namespace Base

@section Nebula3BaseSystem The Nebula3 Base Namespace

The Base subsystem contains all base classes where platformspecific subclasses are derived from.
Nebula3 uses a compile-time-approach for portable code whenever possible. Platform-specific
classes are often derived from a common base class, and then derived into a platform-neutral
class name. For instance, the CoreGraphics::RenderDevice class may be (conditionally) derived 
from Xbox360::Xbox360RenderDevice or from Direct3D::D3D9RenderDevice, which in turn are
derived from the class Base::RenderDeviceBase which contains common funtionality of all
RenderDevice classes.

The main reason why the Base namespace has been introduced is to not contanimate the
autodocs and IntelliSense with unrelated information.
