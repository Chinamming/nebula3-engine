/**
@namespace System

The Nebula3 System subsystem offers close-to-the-metal classes
which expose information about or manipulate system-level 
aspects of the host platform, for instance information about the 
CPU, byte order or available hardware capabilities. Some classes
offer access to platform-specific features, like the Windows
registry.
